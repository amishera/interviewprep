The difference between the two lines lies in the **syntax** and **when you are allowed to use each form**. Functionally, they are equivalent and result in the same `int[]` array being created, but there are specific rules about where and how you can use each.

---

### **1. Example 1:**
```java
int[] empIds = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```
- **Description:**
    - This is a shorthand (concise) syntax for array initialization.
    - The compiler infers the array type (`int[]`) from the context.
    - It can **only** be used when you are both **declaring and initializing** the array in a single statement.

---

### **2. Example 2:**
```java
int[] empIds = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};
```
- **Description:**
    - This is the explicit syntax for creating and initializing an array.
    - The `new int[]` explicitly declares that you're creating a new array of type `int[]` with the given values.
    - This form is more verbose and can be used in **any context** where an array needs to be created, even when declaration and initialization are not combined.

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**                | **`int[] empIds = {1, 2, 3, 4};`**                      | **`int[] empIds = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};`**                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**                | Shorthand syntax.                                       | Explicit syntax using `new`.                                    |
| **Compiler Inference**    | Compiler infers the array type.                         | Array type is explicitly specified.                             |
| **Where Allowed**         | Only allowed when declaration and initialization are combined. | Can be used even when declaration and initialization are separate. |
| **Use Case**              | Used for simplicity and brevity.                       | Used when more control is required or in complex scenarios.     |

### **When the Explicit Form is Needed**
The explicit form is required in the following cases:

1. **When assigning to an already declared variable:**
   ```java
   int[] empIds;
   empIds = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4}; // Explicit form required.
   ```

2. **When passing an array to a method:**
   ```java
   someMethod(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4}); // Explicit form required.
   ```

   The shorthand form would not work here:
   ```java
   someMethod({1, 2, 3, 4}); // Compilation error.
   ```

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Use the shorthand (`int[] empIds = {1, 2, 3, 4};`) when declaring and initializing an array in the same statement for simplicity.
- Use the explicit form (`int[] empIds = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4};`) when you need to initialize the array separately from its declaration or in more complex scenarios.
