An **immutable fold** refers to an operation where intermediate results are not directly modified, but rather new instances of the result container are created at each step of the folding process. This contrasts with a **mutable fold**, where a single container is updated (mutated) during the process.

### **Example of Mutable Fold (Using `collect()`):**
A **mutable fold** allows a single, mutable result container (like a `List` or `Map`) to be modified by adding elements to it as the stream is processed.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> result = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**How it works:**
- The `toList()` collector uses a mutable `ArrayList`.
- As elements are processed from the stream, they are directly added to the same `ArrayList` instance (no new lists are created).
- This approach is efficient because it avoids creating new objects repeatedly.

### **Example of Immutable Fold:**
An **immutable fold** creates a new instance of the result at each step, without modifying the original container.

Example (using `reduce()`):
```java
int sum = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4)
    .reduce(0, (subtotal, element) -> subtotal + element);
```

**How it works:**
- The `reduce()` operation calculates the sum of the elements.
- At each step, a new "subtotal" is calculated without modifying the previous subtotal directly.
- The process does not depend on a single mutable object being updated.

### **Key Difference**
1. **Mutable Fold:**
    - A single result container (e.g., `List`, `Set`) is reused and updated.
    - Example: Collecting into a `List` via `Collectors.toList()`.

2. **Immutable Fold:**
    - Intermediate results are immutable, so each step creates a new instance with the updated value.
    - Example: Using `reduce()` to calculate a sum or concatenate strings.

---

### **Efficiency:**
- **Mutable folds** are generally more efficient because they reuse the same container, minimizing memory usage and object creation overhead.
- **Immutable folds** are safer for functional programming paradigms but can be less efficient due to frequent creation of new objects.

### **Analogy:**
- **Mutable Fold:** Imagine filling a single bucket with water. Each time, you add water directly to the same bucket.
- **Immutable Fold:** Imagine you create a new bucket every time you add more water, so the result is always in a brand-new container. The old bucket stays untouched.
